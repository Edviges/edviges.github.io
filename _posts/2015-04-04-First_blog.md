This is my fist live blog post using Jekyll. I came across Jekyll while trying to 
hunt down for a simple light weight CMS for blogging over which i can have all the control.
I already have a wordpress (<a href="https://slaaysourcecoders.wordpress.com">slaaysourcecoders.wordpress</a>)  blog but i wanted somthing different and something new that 
would make me dig into the code and Jekyll was the answer!
Jekyll in few words is <i>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.</i>
