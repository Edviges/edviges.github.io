I has been a while since i started with coding and hosting public repos on GitHub. I first start forking random repos that interested me alot.
Then i moved on to create my own repo. The reason i chose GitHub was simple for me as Github is huge and damn easy to search and use.
Since i got myself a MAC Mini and using GitHub was really very simple. I believe in open source and sharing (is caring ;)). So all my source
codes are openly available on Github, Even this website built using Jekyll!
